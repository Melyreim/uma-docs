Hi! I made this video to practice my English. My wording or pronunciation might be wrong sometimes – please bear with me!

## **First: Why Wit (Intelligence) is CRUCIAL**

- **It's Fundamental:** Wit is absolutely essential in this game.
- **Mistake:** Simply pressing "Rest" doesn't increase your stats and can sometimes make your horse girl sick.
- **The Solution:** Wit increases through various training methods. High Wit prevents sickness _and_ boosts Energy recovery. **Focus on training Wit heavily.**

## **Beginner Trap: Tenno Sho (Spring)**

- You _can_ win this race by relying on Wit and Recovery skills alone. Official game information also states that **Wit is important**.

## **Support Card Recommendations**

1. **Daiwa Scarlet (スカーレット): MY PICK**
    - Even at low levels, she has a high SSR ("Rainbow") appearance rate. If you have her, use her.
2. **Fine Motion (ファインモーション): Popularity King**
    - Number 1 in popularity and great for status growth. However, she has no innate Rainbow effect. Ignore the meme "This is the only wit you need" – that's not her actual perfomance.
    - **Crucial:** You MUST have her at Level 45 or above. Look for Level 50 Friend supports to rent. At lower levels (like SR), her performance isn't great.
3. **Sweep Tosho (スイープトウショウ): The Best SR**
    - The top-tier SR card for earning SP and getting more skills. For SR cards, Sweep Tosho is the only one truly worth using "for the time being".
4. **Kitasan Black (キタサンブラック): The ESSENTIAL "GOD" Card**
    - **Very, very, VERY necessary.** Has an incredibly high Rainbow rate.
    - Her Rainbow effect hasn't been surpassed for 3 years. She's treated like a "God" in the Japanese version.
    - **SAVE YOUR CARATS (Jewels) TO SCOUT KITASAN BLACK.**

## **About Stamina Support Cards**

- **2500m Arima Kinen Focus:** Prioritize **High Wit + Recovery Skills**. Low Stamina stats are manageable here.
- **Unique Recovery:** Unlock potential for Gold Recovery skills like "Tachyon / Creek" (タキオン／クリーク). These are highly recommended for beginners in long races.
- **Team Trials Strategy:** Top Japanese rankers often **do NOT increase Stamina** significantly. Why?
    - The keys in Team Trials are: **1)** Gaining many skills, and **2)** Activating those skills.
    - **Wit is always necessary** to protect these two goals. **This is MORE important than Stamina.**
- **When Stamina _Is_ Enough:** Stamina is easily raised during Summer Camp when support cards are gathered. A minimum level is sufficient for most races.
- **Future Change (Stamina Battle):** A later update (called "StaminaBattle"?) will convert Stamina _value_ into Speed. **However:**
    - This update is far off.
    - It won't affect Sprint or Mile races much.
    - It will be less common in Medium distances.
    - For Long races, support cards like **Distribution McQueen (配布マクイーン)** or **SR Cafe (SRカフェ)** are sufficient.
- **Scouting Advice:** Only scout for Stamina cards **at the same time as Wit cards**, if a good banner appears (this happened occasionally in Japan). **For now, you can manage WITHOUT dedicated Stamina support cards.** Many top Japanese players didn't have them.

## **About Power Support Cards**

- **Focus on Speed:** To increase Speed, prioritize Speed training. Power will naturally increase as a result. It's better to use Speed support cards.
- **The Blocking Problem:** No matter how high your Power is, getting blocked during a race is inevitable.
- **When Power Support _Might_ Be Used:**
    - Cards like **Gold Ship (ゴールドシップ) + Hishi Amazon (ヒシアマゾン)** for the crucial "Straightaway Spurt" acceleration skill needed in Long races.
    - **Acceleration Skills are KEY:** Skills activate where the race arrow points – this is **very, very, very important** (will be explained in a separate video).
- **Future Power Support (Rice Shower):** A powerful Power support card ("Rice Shower") might be implemented in ~6 months? It requires Maestro and lots of Carats. **Until then, Power support cards are generally NOT needed.** Based on my experience and many Japanese players, you can skip them.

## **About Guts Support Cards**

- **Future Importance:** Guts will become vital once the "Oikurabe" (追い比べ - "The Final Contest"?) mode is implemented.
- **Recommendations:**
    1. **Haru Urara (ハルウララ):** Available in the shop, she's treated as essential as Kitasan Black! She will be useful for a very long time.
    2. **Event/Free Supports:** Other strong Guts cards haven't been released for 3 years. Until then, focus on Haru Urara and event/free support cards. **No Carats needed!**
- **Stamina/Power/Guts TL;DR:** You don't urgently need top cards for these stats right now. **Focus your Carats on Kitasan Black!**

## **Saving Carats & Scouting**

- **Save Trophy Rewards:** Pay attention to trophies! The arrow indicates hidden rewards ("dark area"). You _can_ earn Carats from these.
- **Top Trophy Earners:** Focus on horses like **Bakushin O (バクシンオー), Oguri Cap (オグリキャップ), and Haru Urara (ハルウララ)**. These three cover most rewards.
- **Save Strategically:** You can save **30,000 Carats** (I've done it!). The Japanese version had a Kitasan Black reprint banner.
- **Future Uncap Items:** Updates will add more items for uncapping support cards (both paid and free).
- **Scout Wisely:** **When the Kitasan Black banner comes, do the 200 consecutive draws (spark/pity system) to guarantee getting her!**
