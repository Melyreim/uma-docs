# Gacha

The SSR/3* rates in Umamusume are 3%, with rate-up cards and umas appearing 0.75% of the time usually. You’ll get the rate-up thing ¼ times you get an SSR/3*. This is the same whether there are two rate-ups or only one. Each rate-up will be 0.75%, it doesn’t go up to 1.5% for single rate-ups. Because of this, dual banners tend to be preferred to pull on.

You also get to pick any of the rate-up things after doing 200 pulls, which is known as sparking, a term originating from Granblue Fantasy. (though, it’s a bit confusing with inheritance also being sparks on Global…) To get MLB SSRs, you will on average need to spark twice. Pities do not carry over across banners. If you do 100 pulls on one banner, you will start from 0 on the next, not from 100.

In terms of USD, if you want to whale, one spark will run you $240 if you get them on sale, and about $408 at full price, or roughly two dollars per pull. The 2500 pack is the “best value” after getting all the sales and monthly pass. They renew the sale packs from time to time.

There are no limited umas. You can pull any character, even the summer or Christmas ones, at any time. Some welfare support cards are event-exclusive, but otherwise there are also no limited support cards.

Here’s a table showing what you can expect from certain numbers of pulls, pity included, for any given rate-up.

**SSR**

| Pulls | None | 0LB | 1LB | 2LB  | 3LB  | MLB  |
| ----- | ---- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 50    | 69%  | 26% | 5%  | 0.6% | 0.1% | 0%   |
| 100   | 47%  | 36% | 13% | 3%   | 0.6% | 0.1% |
| 200   | 0%   | 22% | 34% | 25%  | 13%  | 6%   |
| 300   | 0%   | 11% | 24% | 27%  | 20%  | 19%  |
| 400   | 0%   | 0%  | 5%  | 15%  | 22%  | 58%  |
| 500   | 0%   | 0%  | 2%  | 9%   | 17%  | 72%  |
| 600   | 0%   | 0%  | 0%  | 1%   | 5%   | 94%  |

Sometimes, there will be an uma banner with no rate up. This happened for New Year’s 2021 on the JP server. In this case, you can spark any uma.
