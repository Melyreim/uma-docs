# Tips for New Players

1. Save your 3* uma pick ticket until you finish the [missions](https://gametora.com/umamusume/missions/permanent). The missions grant you tickets that give a random 3* uma, so you want to avoid getting dupes in this way.
	- If you have a favourite uma among those nine, you can use the ticket on them if the random tickets didn’t give you her. If you want to pick for strength, Oguri Cap, Taiki Shuttle, and Maruzensky are the best. Oguri Cap is a very flexible uma and can run in a lot of things competently, Taiki Shuttle is the strongest when she’s good, and Maruzensky is a great parent for a lot of umas.

2. Join a [Club](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h114yzawowl) as soon as you can, preferably one with many members. These are like guilds. By giving people the shoes they request, you will receive [Club Points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.95zmmb6vyfd0), which can be used to limit break the story SSR cards.
 
3. Don’t buy anything from the random shops that sometimes appear, except for clocks. Money is very precious in this game and the items in the shops are not very valuable. The pennants can be worth it if you absolutely know you need that certain pennant.
	- If you collect 150 pieces for a 3* uma, you can exchange them to get that uma. This is quite expensive, costing over 2 million money per uma, and would take years. If you don’t pull on umas, getting the 1* and 2* shards to unlock their outfit is fine. Once Daily Legend Races are added, you can buy pieces to accelerate the ones you’re targeting.

4. Borrow other players’ umas as parents whenever you can. You can do this three times a day. At the start, your parents will give +15 stats, while a borrowed parent can give +63 stats. There are also the two Inspiration events, so your own give roughly 45 total, while the rented ones give roughly 189 total. Additionally, any uma you make with the rented +63 parents will give at least +31 stats (~+91 total), making your start much better.
  
5. SR cards are strong. They’re easy to get duplicates of, so typically you’ll be using limit broken SRs rather than 0LB SSRs (unless you want the gold skills from those SSRs). Some MLB SRs are even stronger than MLB SSRs. My suggestion is generally to pull on support cards until you get usable MLB SRs, then save your jewels for umas you like or to do a large amount of rolls on good SSRs ([on average](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4h978qax10ir) it takes 400 rolls to MLB an SSR card).

6. Don’t use auto for anything. Whether it’s [picking decks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.eojylwcplssq), picking parents, or [picking your PvP team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rbnaasa6ngsy), the game’s pretty bad at it. Learn how to do them yourself as soon as you can.
