07/09/2025:

Erzzy

- Added some more information about how important stamina is because I saw some truly insane stat goal suggestions being passed around.
- The uma reviews will be more Global-focused soon… soon…
- Bullied pecan into making a global version of the [skill visualizer](https://alpha123.github.io/uma-tools/skill-visualizer-global/), replaced stuff in [Analyzing Tracks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9ej5vgcc96yg)
- Changed the [Support Card Builds](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9d3peshfq7pp) to use images instead
- [Affinity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3jozplosfqai) section

07/08/2025:

Erzzy

- Opened JP uma and added a [How Bad is the Power Creep?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2k21qvxr08tu) Section
- Added [Gold Skill Rates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ft0k3aky023c). Strange that, that was never added into the ref doc.

# To-Do List/Current Plans:

- Update JP Screenshots to Global/EN Screenshots (when I’m not being lazy, sorry my fellow visual learners. - Kirei)
- Plans on attempting to make certain sections more clear/coherent (also, when I’m just not being lazy…- Kirei)
- Copy over the Uma Reviews from the main ref doc as they release. Erzzy note: You can put the most recent ones up on the first page so people can see the reviews for the current banner easily. Maybe I’ll keep adding notes, we’ll see.
- Update page 2 with the monthly previews from twitter
