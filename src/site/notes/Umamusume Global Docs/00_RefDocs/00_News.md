This guide is aimed towards players who want to optimize performance in competitive PvP modes. If you only want to read the stories or collect the horse girls, you won’t need much of this. Banner reviews will also assume you are a free-to-play player.

# Current Goals To Be Working Towards

- Gather Power and Stamina [legacies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wufh6gcsn1hs). Any parents you rent should have a 3* Blue Power/Stamina spark on the base uma, to become a grandparent. Power is mainly used for Medium, Stamina is used everywhere. Wit legacies can also be used in Sprint, Speed ones are used for Guts builds which aren’t yet meta, and Guts legacies have no current use, only becoming useful 2-3 years later.
- Trade shoes in your Club to gain the [currency](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.peph7846fppq) to bring the [McQueen Stamina welfare](https://gametora.com/umamusume/supports/30022-mejiro-mcqueen) from the main story to 3LB. MLB is very minor. You’ll want this card for Long distance
- Pity the Kitasan banner if you’re going to. Then, look for an Uma banner you like and pull enough to bring all your 1-2 star umas to 3 star with dupes and statues, which both makes their unique skill stronger and allows them to pass it down through their legacies.
- Gather the Garlands needed to [Awaken](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mf5377rc9y0b) your important umas. If you want to use [Debuffers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2zda6gvxglny), fully awakening Nice Nature is important, and needs 45 Kikuka Sho garlands.
- Get enough points in the event to MLB the Tannhauser welfare. She’s useful later

## Support Banners

### Yukino Bijin + Nishino Flower SR

Not a terrible banner to roll on, despite its appearances. Bijin’s skill gets buffed later and becomes very potent. Having one copy of her will let you avoid borrowing her. If you have a favourite uma, and that uma is not good, running her as a Late Surger in Champion’s Meeting with Bijin’s skill is a way to get some wins no matter who it is. If you’re done with the Kitasan banner, and want to do more support pulls to limit break more SRs, this is fine. The Nishino SR is also top tier in scenario 3 (she has 15% Race Bonus), but that’s a long ways away. Note that there might be a Creek + Tazuna banner coming up that you might want to save for instead, or you could be pulling umas to upgrade the 1-2*s and start making better parents.

### Kitasan Black + Satono Diamond

First off, you only need to pull on supports if you have a desire to compete in PvP such as [Champion’s Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.n319dua1dy0z). If you’re just here for the cute horses, you can ignore the cards (and probably this entire doc). However, if you want to compete in PvP, Kitasan is a huge boon and one of the strongest generic cards for a long while. Having her will help you out a lot, but you need to get her to at least 3LB for her to show her strength. Also, getting limit breaks on your SRs is important anyway, and this is the best place to secure those.

> [!Warning] Warning! The banner is 0.5% rate up!
>  This makes the value of pulls significantly worse, almost half as bad. Your chance of getting no Kitas in 200 pulls is now 37% instead of 20%. This was the case on the JP server too, but people were optimistic that it would be 0.75%. For rerolls, it’s about 1 in 8 for 1LB, and 1 in 50 for 2LB. You can do 110-120 on a fresh account.

If you don’t have 30,000 Carats, pulling would be an 80% chance of throwing your savings away. But, if you've been saving your Carats, you should have 30,000 by now. Do 200 pulls on the Kitasan banner, then check how many Kitasan copies you pulled and act accordingly:

- 0 - Unlucky. Use the pity on Diamond and borrow Kitasan for the next 7 months. By the time you could get your own Kitasan ready to use, you'd have other options. Or start your account over…
- 1~2 - Use the pity on Kitasan, then use the uncap gem and pick ticket you get later to bring her to 3+LB. You’ll have to wait a while, but 3LB is usable.
- 3 - Use the pity on Kitasan, then use the pick ticket later to MLB her. The gem can be used for any SSR, so it'll save you from bad luck on a later banner, while the pick ticket is limited to early cards.
- 4 - Use the pity on Kitasan. You did it.
- 5 - Lucky. Use the pity on Diamond.

Any pulls you do past 200 are gambling. Be aware you could be burning your gems for no return. Diamond isn't worth going out of your way for (her gold heal is very weak before the buff), but she's a good Stamina stat stick if you managed to get her along the way. The pick ticket and uncap gem both came during the half anniversary on JP, which was at the Aoharu release.

## Why are we so focused on Kitasan?

It’s easy to say she’s the best Speed card for a long time, but why?

- The most frequent rainbows possible. At MLB, she appears on Speed training 33% of the time. For comparison, Sweep Tosho SR MLB appears on it 25% of the time.
- Good events. Her first two chain events give mood up, letting you skip recreation.
- Generically good gold skill that can be used on every uma in every* situation.
- Power Bonus lets you skimp on Power cards, great stats in general.
- Having her yourself means you don’t need to borrow her and can borrow other things.

*There is one Sprint distance track with no corners. Every other track has at least two.

## Uma Banners - (pull if you like the uma, rather than if they’re good)

### Curren Chan (Original)

[Ratings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xvtw79685p4f): Pace Chaser 4, Team Trials 5? (Sprint Pace Chaser), Parent 1, Speed Debuffer (-0.25)

Curren is a gambler in Sprints. If her unique triggers late enough to bring the accel into the spurt, she’s pretty strong. However, Sprint CMs tend to be dominated by Front Runners and End Closers, so she’s not quite meta, but always a fine choice. She’s probably good in Team Trials, her golds are consistent and her unique should trigger most of the time.

### Mejiro McQueen (Anime)

[Ratings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xvtw79685p4f): Front 2, Pace 2, Team Trial 5 (Long Front/Pace), Parent 2

Bird McQueen doesn’t really have anything going for her in CM, but at least she’s consistent in Team Trial and has a heal for Long. She’s outclassed even when her unique carries over and can’t compete in Long CMs against the meta Pace Chasers or Fronts until her buffs which come much later. Though, after those buffs, she is quite strong.

### Tokai Teio (Anime)

Ratings: Pace 3, Team Trial 5 (Medium Pace), Parent 3

Red Teio is a little better than OG Oguri, but has nothing to make her exceptional. Everything is consistent for Team Trial and her unique can be inherited on Pace Chasers for 0.25 speed. Two gold recoveries in Medium means you get to skimp on Stamina quite a bit.
