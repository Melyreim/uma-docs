# Recorded Example A Rank Runs With Bad Cards

Each of these runs uses the weakest cards I own and manages to reach A rank while being PvP viable, more or less following the [above flowchart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sahct85oatej). There’s one for each distance, each using a different build. If you’re struggling to make A ranks, then watching them might help. I’d recommend using 2x playback speed.

Many of them take Iron Will just because there aren’t any good skills to buy with these cards. With better cards (aka almost any other cards), you’ll have more wiggle room to do more races or train secondary stats, as well as be able to buy better skills.

## Sprint Distance King Halo - 4 Speed 2 Power

King Halo is considered the hardest Sprint uma to raise. Borrowing a 9* Stamina uma from a friend gives her enough Stamina for PvP Sprint as well as to survive the early longer races.

## Mile Daiwa Scarlet - 5 Speed 1 Power

The inheritance goes entirely into Stamina for this Daiwa. Her bonuses are 10% Speed 20% Guts. 20% Guts is a bad bonus, this build would work better on any other Mile uma.

## Medium Distance Winning Ticket - 5 Speed 1 Stamina

This run was quite lucky in terms of events, but unlucky in terms of rainbows. The inheritance is the same as the Daiwa, all in Stamina. Super Creek is typically required for Medium, borrow her if you don’t own her.

## Long Distance Matikanefukukitaru - 2 Speed 4 Stamina

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKokq9rqRKfX-C-iSbdvdbpY9y97xYEGcKW5ULtuBXR0l_Dc3MUewJLGjH-XkoGnOANDSiTu1aEmvw0c4yUNIHLxF36DUlJOWZXK_oui5D4HpMxaXdvhutXrabRE57AewMgH_Q?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

Matikanefukukitaru has a 20% Stamina bonus, so a 4 Stamina build takes advantage of that, inheriting a lot of Speed. Without using Kitasan, the Power is quite low, which is why I purchased the Good Condition green early on, for the +40 Power. Unfortunately I can’t unlevel my McQueen SSR, but it only takes ten days with a good circle to get it to 2LB anyway.

At the time of writing this, the Legend Race vs McQueen is going on, a 3200m race. This Matikanefukukitaru is able to take first place in it.

# Other Recorded Runs

## A + Mile Oguri Cap With MLB SRs - 4 Speed 2 Power

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfFHKm4hN_AapSljeoaxCPgbxc-Ij9dJDQizi1cnYsZHNe31zlZcuPP4Gqr6S1ZPlDMDRFhkDmUMz_FeIRSz8FJgpABbGXbM2yqt5sZUwFVgc8k2lHTt-MffznApCUAMBZMzb2y4g?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

Once you get MLB SR cards, making A+ umas becomes pretty easy. This run took me two tries. The first attempt, she got sick, didn’t cure it with two hospital visits, and lost 5 mood in the meantime, so I quit it at the start of second year. This run was better, though I did forget to do Satsuki Sho. Skill points help a lot with rank.

## 3 * Blue Factor Farm Tokai Teio - 4 Speed 1 Guts 1 Wit

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeTyw3e7BWrWm6m6GV75KCHEGgZgGh1LeDK8cC002Xwhc55lGX57aGZ76mu5CAan9hRyJ0HhgQEt-PqINoh4nsoUP1RtN1emwNxZSU5QHrcF-lAL1h-EO5jTzBmzqLpMj4i_Qtm?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

In order for an uma to receive a [3* blue spark](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.n2nc1lxpxy9c), she must have 600 or more in that stat. This build aims for exactly that, getting 600 in every stat. Other things to look out for in legacy farms are races that the parents also did, to improve affinity. I did a poor job of this, only doing 16 races. You should also try to get skills that you want white factors for. I was unlucky with this and only received Medium Straightaways, while also looking for Medium Corners, Late Surger Corners, and Late Surger Straightaways. The uniques are also all aimed for Late Surgers, with Teio, Rudolf, and Oguri having strong uniques for Late Surgers to inherit.

Something to note is that when a stat reaches 1100, the chance of it giving a 3* blue factor doubles. You could raise Speed more for that, but I didn’t want a Speed blue anyway.
