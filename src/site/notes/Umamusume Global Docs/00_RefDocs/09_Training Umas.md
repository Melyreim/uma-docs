# Training Umas

The umas you pull from the gachas are not completed umas. They are merely templates, which you can use to make clones of that uma to then train into something that can race. You can make these templates stronger by increasing their star count or level. Doing so won’t increase the strength of already-trained umas.

When you go to train an uma, you’ll be greeted with this screen at first, where you select the uma you want to train.

Umas with a golden border are level 3 or higher, which is raised by trading shoes and pennants. Stars can be raised by trading pieces, which are acquired by pulling duplicates from the gacha, trading statues in the shop, and various other things that aren’t consistently available. At three stars, an uma unlocks her unique racing outfit and gains the ability to pass down her unique skill through inheritance. Skills at three stars are also notably stronger than their 1 or 2 star counterparts.

Selecting an uma won’t consume that uma. It makes a fresh copy. Every time you do a training run, you’ll start with a fresh clone of that uma with the template’s base stats.
