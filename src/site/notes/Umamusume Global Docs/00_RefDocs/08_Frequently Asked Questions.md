# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can’t I put this uma I just pulled on my PvP team?
You didn’t train them yet. Read [Gametora’s Beginner Guide](https://gametora.com/umamusume/beginners-guide).

## Is this card I just pulled good?
0LB SSRs will be worse than SRs with LBs, so probably not. Check the [Tier List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jpfj8zg4p9m8).

## What build should I use for X? 
Check the builds [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.eojylwcplssq). 

## What Scenario should I play in?
You only have one scenario right now! But, the newest scenario will be the best, whichever is furthest right. When making parents, some scenarios give unique skills that you might want to inherit.

## Who should I use for loop breeding for X?
Global is out and people are still talking about loop breeding? Don’t do loop breeding unless you’re prepared to do 500 runs. You can safely forget it exists, it gives little benefit over normal training. Just see the [Beginning Breeding Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wufh6gcsn1hs).

## Why did I lose this race even though all my stats are way higher than the opponents’?
You probably got blocked. Your uma can get surrounded by other umas and be unable to move sometimes. It just happens, nothing you can really do about it. In story and such you can pick Front Runner as the style every time to mitigate this, but it can still happen with a late start.

## How do I win this race? (eg for a mission, or in the main story, or anything)
The most common issue is lack of Stamina. Refer to the [Required Stamina Chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5gejlihfmr29). Lower it by 600 in training, as Career gives you secret stat boosts. If your Stamina is fine, probably your Power is the issue. Make sure your uma also has A or better for the surface and distance.

## What skills should I buy here?
Pick one distance and one style your uma has A or better in. Buy skills that have that at the end of the skill. For example, if the skill ends in (Pace Chaser) it can only be activated by Pace Chasers, and if it ends with (Long), it only activates in Long distances. You can also buy skills that have nothing in brackets at the end, unless they’re at the top of the list (uniques). That’s fine to start. For more advanced buying criteria, see the [Skill Rankings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4tonsji7onb5).

## Do debuffs affect my own umas in team races?
That’d make them pretty pointless. No, they don’t.

## Do debuffs stack?
Yes. All skills stack. Yes, even if they have the same name.

## Can I check how many races I’ve done while still in training?
Open the menu bottom right and click the button with the trophy icon.

## Does this skill work outside of training?
Yes. Any skill you can buy can be used anywhere.

## Can green skills increase your stats beyond the cap?
The internal stat caps are 2000. Green skills can raise your stats to 2000.

## How do I get rid of umas I don’t want?
Go to the Hall of Fame and press the button in the bottom right, then click the umas you want to sell. Double check their [inheritance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4qbf55ysbjo9) first, you wouldn’t want to accidentally sell a good parent.

## Do we know what the next banner is?
I’d hope so. They post them on Twitter, and it’s probably on the second page of this doc.

## When will X get rerun?
You can look at the banner history for the JP server for an idea, but we don’t quite know if the reruns will be the same yet.

## Is this character limited?
No, there are no limited umas. Other than event welfares, there are also no limited support cards. Later, they’ll add the ability to revisit old events for the welfares if you need one.

## When does this banner/event end?
The end times listed in-game are in your local time.

## Which card do I spend my Club Points on?  
This is answered in the [Club Point](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.peph7846fppq) section.

## What do the three shapes mean in races?
Don’t worry about it. Just think of them as representations of your Speed, Stamina, and Power relative to the field.

## Is Erzzy playing Global?
I’ll reroll for Kitasan and then aim to win every race with Dober for the title. No current plans to participate in any discords.
