# Support Card Tier Lists

Check out the Tier List here: [https://euophrys.github.io/uma-tiers/#/global](https://euophrys.github.io/uma-tiers/#/global) 

Pick a preset or enter the cards you know you’ll be using and it will show you the best cards to add to that deck, stats-wise. You may want other cards for their skills, like Super Creek.

The scores shown are for adding the card to the currently selected deck. If you have 0 Power cards, then the scores are for when that card is the only Power card. If you have 2 Power cards, then the scores are for when that card is the third Power card, and so on.

## Customizing the Tier Lists

If you have your own opinions about what makes a support card strong, you can alter the tier list to fit your vision. The default should be good enough for most use cases.

You can enter the exact deck you’re using to see a fully customized ranking for your situation. Or, if you just want to see a general overview, you can use the Presets below the deck display.

If you want to customize the parameters, here’s some advice.

For Bond Rate, you can increase it if you have cards you don’t want to bond. For example, in Racing decks, there are typically two cards that don’t get bonded at all, such as Nishino Flower SR. You can count these as 7 extra bonus bond per turn or so.

The Optional Races should be self-explanatory. If you use a racing agenda, you can copy the numbers over.

Rainbow Multiplier is for MANT runs. You can ignore it for now. It defaults to 1.4, which would be a mid-tier megaphone. If you only train with multiple items, you could increase it to 1.7 or even 1.9 (mid + weight).

The Stat Weights section is setup in a fairly standard way. Guts is an exception, with Speed and Power being given doubled weight. Increase the stats you care about, decrease the stats you don’t. For example, maybe on a Sprint uma, you would minimize Stamina’s weight.

Average Motivation is what it says. If you train on orange a lot due to racing, you could lower it to 15% or 10%.

For the Stat Cap, you can increase it if you cap the stat early on in most of your runs.

Minimum Training Value will prune out undesirable trainings. If you only train on double rainbows, this can be raised. The number includes skill points and is calculated before items.
