# Your First Month In Uma

There’s a lot to do when you first start an account. Here’s a checklist, roughly in order of when you should do them.

- [[Umamusume Global Docs/00_RefDocs/02_Rerolling\|Reroll]] if you’re going to. It’s extremely helpful.
- Level up cards that you take on runs, but not others. You have a limited amount of resources for leveling things up in the beginning and it’s better to take a small amount of cards to max than level a bunch a little bit. Check the [builds here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.eojylwcplssq).
- Read the [Basic Training Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sahct85oatej). Your horse girls will thank you.
- [Add some friends](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.bio8lk9a88e1) with good parents and rent them while doing runs.
- Win every graded race once. When going to the [optional race](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qxk7q4hqrejf) screen, if there’s a grayed-out trophy in the top right, you haven’t won that race. Each one you win for the first time gives you jewels, so try to clear each once.
- If any uma you train results in a three star blue, or two star blue and three star pink, click the carrot icon in the top left and mark them as a good parent you shouldn’t delete. Use umas like this as parents when starting runs once you get them. [Inheritance details here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4qbf55ysbjo9).
- Pull to pity on the current support card banner if you rerolled on it (200 total pulls) to get at least one more copy of the banner card.
- Do 30-50 rolls on umas to collect the 1 and 2 star umas. After this, start saving up jewels for either umas you like, or better support cards. Ideally, you shouldn’t pull without a spark ready (30,000 jewels). Two sparks gives you a [50/50 chance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4h978qax10ir) of MLBing an SSR.
- Train an uma for each [Team Trials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qaokkuq6ms0p) distance. For brand new players, that would be Bakushin in Sprint, Vodka in Mile, Daiwa in Medium, Gold Ship in Long, and Urara in Dirt.
- With those umas, you should be able to clear the main story to get the free SSRs.
- Join a [Club](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h114yzawowl) with many members and start trading shoes for Club Points, which can be used to limit break the free SSRs from the story. You can additionally get up to 100 medals per day from people borrowing your uma. You can use reroll accounts to do this yourself each day, if you want to speed things up.
- Finish off any of the [missions](https://gametora.com/umamusume/missions/permanent) you’re still missing. Once they’re complete, you can use the random gacha tickets, then use the 3* Uma select ticket with less fear of getting duplicates later. (Oguri, Maruzensky, and Taiki are the strongest choices)
- Each week, you’ll go up a Team Trials class and unlock another 5 slots, so keep filling them in as that happens. You’ll get a lot of jewels and friendship points from the class upgrades and team rank upgrades. Here’s a [full F2P team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rbnaasa6ngsy).
- Use the Friendship Points gained from Team Trials to get all the copies of Urara from the Friendship Point shop. Once you have her MLB, go for the follow slots.

Prepare some umas for the [Champion’s Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.n319dua1dy0z) or League of Heroes for the month once those start. Even if you lose, you’ll still get rewards, so it doesn’t hurt to participate.
