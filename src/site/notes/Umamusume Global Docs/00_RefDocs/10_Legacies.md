# Legacies

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfSnfyfQETGboZ8Iy0VcSkvOdPnUBTHDO7GR6v3o8GrvkZ8deThXen6pBtThtx7gahsGrS1cLvnTzVIEh8hA5d2cpnO6rlvbJL2NzxG5BnNNPrZnXsIu1rEQWPfJQqNr6K7TUIFQA?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

After selecting an uma, you’ll be presented with the legacy screen. Here, you’ll select umas to, as the game puts it, “send feelings” to the uma you’re raising. Most people simply refer to these as the uma’s parents.

Whenever you finish a run with an uma, that uma will receive sparks roughly related to her own abilities. The uma’s actual stats and skills don’t matter at all for inheritance, only these sparks.

You can also borrow umas from people you follow to use as parents.

If you press and hold on a trained uma, it will bring up their stats page. On the second tab, you can see the sparks they and their parents have. All of these can be passed down to the uma you’re training.

As an example, let’s look at the sparks one of my umas has. It’s an Oguri Cap, who had Symboli Rudolf and Mayano Top Gun as her parents.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDhPQLP0hkBf7dWgiab-zKZbCMWtFb7XvcurclYiGKSO7xSVD4rLqZA-HLCNwhQGD62GPo6Qmk9iUwcu5A44MOp5P-Jm43GqIS_VEr2dqBRewmd4OvZyscS_JBqZI24qdcFvC1?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

Blue sparks are stats. The Mayano and Oguri both have 3 star Speed sparks. The Symboli Rudolf has a 3 star Stamina spark. A 1 star spark gives +5 to that stat, a 2 star factor gives +12, and a 3 star gives +21. So, this uma will give +42 Speed and +21 Stamina. We’d refer to her as a 6* Speed 3* Stamina uma.

Pink sparks are for aptitudes. They’ll raise the letter grade of the related aptitudes, in this case, Turf and Medium Distance. You can’t raise them above A at the start, but during the two inspiration events, they might get upgraded to S if there’s a related pink spark in the legacy.

The green and gray sparks are for skills and races. Skill sparks will give hints for the skill of the same name, while [race sparks](https://gametora.com/umamusume/g1-race-factor-list) will give bonus stats. For example, the URA Finale spark can give +10 Speed/Stamina for each star if it activates during an inspiration event. If this Rudolph’s triggered, then our uma in training could get +30 extra Speed and Stamina.

Let’s see how putting this Oguri as a parent changes things.

As expected, it added 42 Speed and 21 Stamina. Mayano’s Medium Distance pink spark raised the distance from G to F. This uma already has an A in Turf, so Oguri’s Turf pink spark doesn’t do anything, but if it gets triggered during an inspiration event, the Turf aptitude will be raised to S.

The stats of the parent umas don’t matter at all at this point. An A rank uma and a C rank uma with the same sparks will both give exactly the same inheritance. Though, the higher the rank, the better the chance of getting good sparks, generally.

One other thing to look out for when selecting inheritance is the affinity, shown in the top right.

A triangle means there’s bad affinity. A circle means there’s good affinity. Two circles means there’s great affinity. Don’t pick worse parents for better affinity, but if you’re indecisive between two of them, affinity can be the tie breaker.

## 3 Star Spark Chance

After finishing a run, the uma gets random sparks to pass down to its future children. The blue one is chosen randomly between the five stats, and then the stars are chosen based on how high that stat is. The pink is chosen randomly between all aptitudes the uma has at A or higher (so, avoid raising more to A if you’re targeting a specific pink). Here’s a chart of the chance to get a 3 star spark based on what the stat is.

| Stat Value    | <600 | 600~1100 | >1100 |
| ------------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1 Star Factor | ~90% | ~50%     | ~20%  |
| 2 Star Factor | ~10% | ~45%     | ~70%  |
| 3 Star Factor | 0%   | ~6%      | ~10%  |

After finishing an uma, a stat is randomly chosen, and then the stars for that stat are chosen. So, if you had 1200 Speed, the chance of getting a 3 star Speed spark would be 20% (the chance of it picking Speed) * 10% (the chance of it being 3 star) for a total of ~2%. It doesn’t matter if you win the run or not.

## Raising Aptitude

During the initial inheritance, the amount the aptitude increases is based on the number of total stars among the pink sparks of the parents and grandparents. Raising it by one rank requires 1 star, then each subsequent rank requires another three stars. You can raise each aptitude a total of four ranks in this way, so an F rank aptitude could only go to B during the initial inheritance, even with 18 total stars.

As an example, Mayano Top Gun has an E rank Dirt aptitude and a D rank Mile aptitude. In order to raise her for Dirt PvP, you would need to raise both to A. Getting Mile to C takes one star, then 3 to get to B, and 3 more to get to A, for a total of 7. The Dirt aptitude requires one more step, so it requires 10 total stars.

In total, this is 17, but it’s not possible to do all at the start since one uma can’t have two different pink aptitudes. You could do 7 Mile and 9 Dirt (3+3+1, 3+3+3), or 6 Mile and 10 Dirt (3+3, 1+3+3+3). One of them will have to be left at B and raised through an inspiration event.

## Chance of Inheriting Sparks

The chance of inheriting sparks is influenced by your total affinity and whether you hit a gold inspiration event, as well as your individual affinity with each uma and whether the uma is a parent or grandparent.

In general, we can summarize these down to having a 5% chance to inherit it per star, so 15% for 3 star. This gets halved when the uma is a grandparent, down to 7.5% for 3 star. This is a rough estimate and not exact.

These add up multiplicatively rather than additively. For example, a parent with 2* representative and 3* on grandparent would be a 1 - (0.9 * 0.925) = ~16% chance to inherit, rather than 10% + 7.5% = 17.5%.

## Chance of Getting White Sparks

When you finish a run, you have a chance to get white sparks for each skill you have. If it’s a white skill, it’s a 20% chance. If it’s a ◎ skill, it’s 25%. If it’s a gold skill, it’s 40%. For each parent or grandparent that also has the spark, this is multiplied by 1.1. So, if you had a white skill that all your parents and grandparents had sparks for, it would be a 20 * (1.1 ^ 6) = 35.43% chance.

Other white sparks, such as race and scenario sparks, follow the same pattern, counting as white skills (so 20% base chance).

For stars, it’s 50% for 1 star, 45% for 2 stars, and 5% for 3 stars. These change to 20% for 1 star, 70% for 2 star, and 10% for 3 star if the uma is SS rank or higher.

## Affinity

The better the affinity, the higher the chance of getting a lot of inherited sparks during the two inspiration events during the training, which happen in early April.

The affinity is decided by a variety of things. At a baseline, each uma has hard-coded affinity with every other uma, which is derived from various things usually related to the real-life umas. Dirt racers tend to have good affinity with other Dirt racers and such. This affinity applies between the uma you’re training and her parents, and between her and her grandparents. Every uma has 0 affinity with themselves, which is significant for grandparents. You can check these numbers on [Gametora](https://gametora.com/umamusume/compatibility).

Triangle is 50 or less affinity, double circle is greater than 150 affinity. There’s no significant jump here, 149 affinity isn’t massively worse than 151. Affinity is linearly useful, 149->150 is the same increase as 150->151. But, the double circle is a good target when you don’t want to bother calculating everything.

You can increase this affinity by doing races. Currently, you get +1 affinity for each graded race you win on both the parent and the grandparent. So, if you won 10 graded races on Oguri, then trained a Teio with the Oguri as a parent and did those same 10 races, you would get +10 affinity for the Teio parent, making it easier to get double circle affinity for your runs. If the other grandparent also did those 10 races, you would have +20 affinity.

If both parents did the race, there’s another bonus. So, if the other parent was a Mayano who did those 10 races, it would be another +10 affinity, for +30 total. Doing races is also good since it gives you more SP, which means more skills, which means more chances for white sparks.

However, later on this gets changed to be +3 per matching G1, with G2s and G3s no longer counting. This applies retroactively, so your parents’ affinities might change after that update. As such, just focus on the G1s when making your parents in this way. They [give good stats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qxk7q4hqrejf) anyway, you should be doing them with some frequency even on normal runs.
