# Finding Friends

## Uma Pure

[https://uma-global.pure-db.com/#/search](https://uma-global.pure-db.com/#/search) 

Fairly self explanatory. Powerful friend searching tool where you can filter by anything you’d ever want, including representative sparks. It does use the [JP terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11X2P7pLuh-k9E7PhRiD20nDX22rNWtCpC1S4IMx_8pQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.q52kkhbbrqui) for many things though.

## (Unofficial) Umamusume: Pretty Derby Discord

Super straight-forward join the discord, choose the server you’re playing on (for our example I’ll be choosing Global), read the rules, than scroll down till you see #friend-ids. From here you can either manually search(or create) for whatever sparks, traits, or Support Cards you wish for. Or you can use the handy tags system to filter what it is you want!

## Official Umamusume: Pretty Derby Discord

[https://discord.gg/umamusume-eng](https://discord.gg/umamusume-eng)  

Although, slightly less functionality. It’s also super straight-forward and simple to use! Simply scroll down till you find #🤝find-friends, than Ctrl+F to look for whatever traits, support cards, or sparks you’re looking for.

## Friends to Search For

With whichever place you like better, try to find these when starting:

1. An uma with 9* Speed (スピード), for Long distance
2. An uma with 9* Stamina (スタミナ), for Mile / Medium distance, and Long when your stamina cards are lacking
3. An uma with 9* Power (パワー), for Sprint distance
4. Any 9* uma with a Mile (マイル) inheritance, for umas like Haru Urara
5. Any 9* uma with a Dirt (ダート) inheritance, for umas like El Condor Pasa and Oguri Cap
6. Any 9* uma with a Sprint (短距離) inheritance, for Air Groove
7. An MLB Kitasan support card from someone with a 9* uma
8. An MLB Super Creek support card from someone with a 9* uma

Bonus points if the umas have URA inheritance as well.

## Adding Friends

Open the menu by clicking the button in the top right of the home screen.

After entering the ID, you’ll see a button like this.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcB4P9Jgw5WeGdEMIjIYMEndRGK28FNnHklTc7hrtuhetnKKwZQb0RXBsYPRBDBDDPhcI7-WAVlFhutS5zOEG_Oa3cEZ6s9QAIFSWUc_O7w56Ee8pVG3z4lbCjsSOKKeKUtxz4pSw?key=fhZ7zmP8tVEVYyEYXLguJQ)

If the button is gray, either you’re capped on follows, or the person has reached the follower cap. You can unfollow someone if it’s the former. In the middle part of the first image, the follow count can be seen at the bottom left, which for me is 9/15. If you’re not capped, then that means they are, and you’ll have to find someone else.
