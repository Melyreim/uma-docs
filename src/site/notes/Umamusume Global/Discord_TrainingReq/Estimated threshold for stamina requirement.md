Sprint: 400 ~ 600 
Mile: 500 ~ 800
Mid: 800 ~ 1000 (may require stamina recovery skills)
Long: 1000 ~ 1200 (requires additional stamina recovery skills)

For training/career run, this is reduced by 400 due to hidden stat multiplier, so the requirement is more like (by the time of Senior Year):
Sprint: You can basically survive with any stamina
Mile: 200 ~ 300
Mid: 300 ~ 500
Long: 600+
